# ATM Machine System

## Introduction

The ATM Machine System is a proposed system that aims to provide users with convenient access to various banking services.
Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) have become an integral part of our daily lives, providing convenient access to banking services. This technical report presents a proposal for an ATM Machine system, outlining its operational process and providing a UML sequence diagram for reference.

### Proposed System Overview

The proposed ATM Machine System offers the following functionalities:

1. **Card Insertion:** Users can insert their bank cards into the ATM to initiate a transaction.

2. **PIN Verification:** Upon card insertion, the system prompts users to enter their Personal Identification Number (PIN). The system verifies the PIN's authenticity with the bank's database.

3. **Transaction Selection:** Users can choose various transaction options, such as withdrawal, balance inquiry, or account management.

4. **Withdrawal:** In this document, we focus on the withdrawal operation. Users specify the amount they wish to withdraw, and the ATM communicates with the bank to approve the transaction.

5. **Cash Dispensing:** If the withdrawal is approved, the ATM dispenses the requested cash amount.

6. **Account Update:** The ATM updates the user's account balance with the bank.

7. **Transaction Completion:** The user retrieves the dispensed cash and the ATM returns the card. The user logs out of the system.

## UML Sequence Diagram

The UML sequence diagram below illustrates the interaction between the user, the ATM, the bank, the cash dispenser, and the account database during a withdrawal operation.

In this sequence diagram:

- The user initiates the process by inserting their card and entering their PIN.
- The ATM verifies the PIN with the bank, and the bank responds with the verification result.
- The user selects a withdrawal, specifies the amount, and the ATM requests the withdrawal from the bank.
- The bank approves the withdrawal, and the ATM communicates with the cash dispenser to dispense cash.
- The ATM updates the user's account balance with the account database.
- Finally, the user retrieves the dispensed cash and completes the transaction.

## Operating Process of the ATM Machine

The operating process of the ATM Machine System can be summarized as follows:

1. **User Authentication:** The process begins with user authentication through card insertion and PIN verification.

2. **Transaction Selection:** The user selects a transaction type, e.g., withdrawal.

3. **Transaction Processing:** The ATM communicates with the bank to process the transaction, which includes approval and withdrawal requests.

4. **Cash Dispensing:** If the withdrawal is approved, the cash dispenser is activated.

5. **Account Update:** The ATM updates the user's account balance in the bank's account database.

6. **Transaction Completion:** The user collects the dispensed cash, removes the card, and logs out.

## Concluding Remarks

The proposed ATM Machine System offers a seamless and secure banking experience for users. While this document provides an overview and a simplified UML sequence diagram, the actual system would require comprehensive design, security measures, and robust error handling. ATM machines play a crucial role in modern banking, and their functionality should be rigorously developed and tested to ensure user satisfaction and security.
